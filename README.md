# TDD Test Driven Development

## Type of testing
- Unit Testing
- TDD

### Python has several modules that we can use
To test our code
  - PyTest
  - UnitTest

**Why TDD**
- TDD helps us minimise the risk of failure before sending the product to production

**steps**
- we will create a file to write our tests
- We will run the test and they will all fail
- we will create a file to write our code
- We will refactor and add the code to pass the tests
